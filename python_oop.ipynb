    "## OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) organizes code into \"objects,\" which are instances of classes—blueprints that define attributes (data) and methods (behavior). Key principles include encapsulation (hiding internal details), inheritance (reusing code across classes), polymorphism (interacting with different classes through a unified interface), and abstraction (simplifying complex systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 Pillars of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is about bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class. It restricts access to the inner workings of the class and allows controlled interactions. This hides the \"how\" and focuses on the \"what,\" ensuring users of a class can only interact with it through a well-defined interface. By using getters and setters for access, encapsulation protects the data from unintended interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a new class (called a subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (called a superclass or parent class). This helps avoid code duplication and promotes a hierarchical class structure. For example, if you have a Vehicle class, subclasses like Car and Truck can inherit common properties (like speed and color) and behaviors (like start and stop) from Vehicle and add their specific ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism lets different classes be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface. This is often achieved through method overriding, where a subclass implements a method defined in the superclass but in its own way. For example, if Animal has a method speak(), subclasses like Dog and Cat can override speak() to provide their specific sounds. Polymorphism enhances flexibility by allowing objects of different classes to be used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by focusing only on essential qualities, ignoring unnecessary details. In OOP, abstraction is often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define a common structure without implementing specifics. For example, an abstract Shape class might require a calculateArea() method, leaving the details of calculating area up to subclasses like Circle and Rectangle. Abstraction thus reduces complexity and enhances code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP in Python organizes code into classes with objects, using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to model real-world concepts effectively."

    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint defining attributes and behaviors for objects—specific instances created from that class. While the class outlines structure (data fields) and actions (methods), an object embodies these, holding unique data. Classes provide organization, while objects bring this structure to life in a program’s runtime."
